The project involves building a basic Task Management application where users can create, update, delete, and view tasks. Here’s a brief overview of what I’m looking for:

User Authentication: Implement a system where users can register, log in, and manage their own tasks.


While the project is straightforward, there are optional features you can implement if you have time, such as task prioritization or due dates. However, the core features listed above are the primary focus.

This project is intended to give you a chance to showcase your understanding and ability to learn PHP/Laravel and your ability to think critically about building and deploying a web application.


# What should the app do
User Authentication: Implement a system where users can register, log in, and manage their own tasks.
- A user can log in and create an account. check
Task Management: Users should be able to add tasks, categorize them (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done), and update or delete them as needed.
- A user can add a task and save it
- A user can update
- A user can delete 

Basic Validation: Ensure that task inputs are validated to maintain data integrity.
Additionally, you will need to deploy this application to a free hosting service like Heroku, Vercel, Linode, whatever makes it accessible via a public URL.
